            Hi Baby, 
            <br>
            <br>
            We are so so so sooooo far away, and I really wish I could spend the day with you and celebrate,
            but for now I'm sending you all my love through this message.
            <br>
            <br>
            I can't believe we've been together for 3 of your birthdays, but we have not been able to spend it together.
            So I hope you can spend it well with your friends and family, and get away from the stupid lab for a day!!!
            <br>
            <br>
            I am so grateful to have you in my life, even though you are busy, I don't feel lonely knowing
            you will message me soon. The way you express yourself in english is so cute and it makes me smile, especially
            when you use cute emoticons like the very first time you sent loopy. I will never forget these memories we've made
            during our time together and I cannot wait for more!
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>I love you so much. üíñ</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            P.S Tell me when you see this message! I have a gift card for you!
          </p>
